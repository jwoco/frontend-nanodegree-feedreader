# Project 6 - Testing the Feedreader

This project uses the Jasmine test tool to create and run tests of the functions provided by the Udacity Feedreader, which is an RSS reader that displays feeds from different sites. The feeds comprise a single page called the Udacity Blog.

To run the Jasmine tests on the Feedreader, open index.htm in a browser. Opening this file display the Udacity Blog and runs the Jasmine tests.

Test results are displayed at the bottom of the page (you may have to scroll).

The results should show that all tests passed.

To view the individual tests, view the file: /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js
